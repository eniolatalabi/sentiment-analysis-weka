wow this product is very impressive i bought the 8oz blueberry and was pleased with packaging price and shipping the powder dissolves instantly even in water ive just been mixing a 14 tsp in a small glass of water for now and drinking it down and it tastes great but will add it to my smoothies and juiced fruit juices next this product is so economical compared to purchasing fresh blueberries especially because there is no waste due to mold or overripe berries thrown away i think you could add this to baked or unbaked foods as well im excited to add more of the superfoods to my diet in this fast and easy way i definitely will being trying the other flavors soon,positive
i found these more than 10 years ago in a health food store after i bought one bag i found myself stopping by that store once a week to get these chips the new york cheddar flavor is so good you will have a hard time not eating a whole bag,positive
this bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool such as scissors dont even try without scissorsthey are crispy and taste like chips that arent advertised as being salted they definitely arent healthy because i can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them and i can see the grease at the bottom of the bag toothey are highquality chips and deserve to be put on your table,positive
i had heard a little about this product from the local pet store then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively the female younger one took to it right away and the older male who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc in it and would usually refuse a diet change actually liked it too the older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request but he totally refused it he is a posh cat after all he still consumes too many calories the fatty but at least i know hes eating good food of course i know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market but i just cant see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there marketed as being healthy why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal is that right ill stay with this for now but stay tunedim updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats i upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them garfield still eats a little too much but hes just a big cat who doesnt exercise much lets face it our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and shes so healthy shes tiny but happy and agile i tried the chicken version of holistic select but garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one ive ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it,positive

this was a disappointment i use other products from this linemanufacturer on a regular basis i bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid stevia in my purse the first time i went to use it the liquid was a dark coloralmost blackand i had to throw out the latte i was trying to sweeten all the manufacturers other liquid products are clear and in fact this is titled clear liquid it must have been outdatedspoiled i had already thrown the packing out so dont know how it was dated i tried calling the amazon supplier but the call rolled into voice mail its not enough money to spend time followingup but it was disappointing,negative
someone brought these to a party we had last month and i didnt put them out because the buffet was full and didnt think anyone would like saltless potato chips last week we had some friends over and these were all i had in the pantry so i put them out oh my gosh they are so good i was so wrong to think they would be bland they are full of real potato flavor wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting i am here on amazon to buy a case i only want to have these with dips truly delicious,positive
